# About
I've been reading Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir which has me in a sci-fi mood. This app is a vision of an air traffic controller's terminal aboard a starport (Stargazer Station) inside an asteroid.

## Credits

### Frontier Developments

The inspiration for this has less to do with Project Hail Mary itself (that takes place on a very different kind of spaceship), but rather [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) by Frontier Developments, and as such credit goes to them for their unique IP which this project draws from. Noteably, the video background and its audio are recorded from within the game, the name Stargazer is an actual [asteroid station](https://www.edsm.net/en/system/stations/id/25525/name/Pleione/details/idS/15823/nameS/Stargazer) in the game, and some of the ideas for the contents of the UI are drawn from mechanics of the game.
